                    <h2>What I do</h2>
                    <p>
                        Having served in Women’s ministry in the past, I am living my best life as the Director of Discipleship Ministries at
                        CrossPoint Alliance Church, where I have attended for the past 22 years! I enjoy painting and having coffee and deep
                        conversations with friends. At the end of the day, my passion is reading, studying and sharing God’s Word while teaching
                        how to apply it to one’s life with inspiring stories, much laughter and occasional tears. I have found pure joy through
                        following God’s call on my life to teach, speak and lead.
