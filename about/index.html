                            I have been married to a lovely man named Gary for
                            32 years! Gary and I enjoy riding our bikes together
                            along with skiing in the winter and traveling when
                            possible. We continue to tell people that marriage
                            gets better with time and effort!

                        <h2>What I do</h2>
                        <p>
                            Having served in Women’s ministry in the past, I am
                            living my best life as the Director of Discipleship
                            Ministries at CrossPoint Alliance Church, where I
                            have attended for the past 22 years! I enjoy
                            painting and having coffee and deep conversations
                            with friends. At the end of the day, my passion is
                            reading, studying and sharing God’s Word while
                            teaching how to apply it to one’s life with
                            inspiring stories, much laughter and occasional
                            tears. I have found pure joy through following God’s
                            call on my life to teach, speak and lead.
