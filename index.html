                            Welcome! My name is Mona Lea and I'm glad you are
                            here! My desire is to support and equip women in
                            their discipleship to Jesus.

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I met Jesus at 11, however, since my parents did not
                        follow Jesus, my life began to look very much like the
                        world around me. By young adulthood I was involved in
                        many illicit, and some illegal activities. At 22, there
                        was an incident that changed my life forever, and drew
                        me back to Jesus. Thus began the adventure of
                        discipleship some 30+ years ago! I have been in Women's
                        ministry for 2 decades and found a sweet spot in
                        ministry speaking at events, encouraging others to join
                        me on this great adventure of loving God with passion
                        and authenticity.
                    </p>

                                Based on Heb 12:1-2, Released to Run is designed
                                to help women find their unique callings in the
                                body of Christ and run the race marked out for
                                them.

                                Based on Phil. 4:6-8, Finding Fearlessness is
                                designed to show women practical ways to combat
                                the disease of this age: anxiety.

                                Based on II Cor. 4:7-9, we take a journey with
                                Paul to find peace in our imperfections.

                                Based on Mark 12:30-31, we will take the
                                teaching of Jesus and explore what it looks like
                                for the everyday women to have a love affair
                                with God that is <q>an ecstatic sort of
                                    relationship that makes the most rapturous

                        Each topic can be broken into different talks to
                        accommodate overnight retreats or day-long conferences.
                        I also give a devotional made for each topic that I
                        provide to the women at the end of the event.

                        I am also happy to take a verse, topic or theme of your
                        choice and work with the Holy Spirit to create an
                        original retreat/conference.
